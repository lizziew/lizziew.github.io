#### Miscolor
##### Tools/Languages: Swift, Xcode
Miscolor is easy to learn but hard to master. This is your chance to race against the clock, fight your instincts, improve your mental agility, and kill time!

Choose the color of the word that appears on the screen, not the word itself. You earn 1 point if you're correct and lose 0.5 points if you're wrong.

You have 15 seconds. Every time you choose 5 in a row correctly, you get 5 extra seconds!
